"""Tests for the pin-assignment solver.

Cases covered:
- Pure: doesn't mutate the input dict.
- Bound pins are left alone, unbound ones get filled in.
- Capability filtering: analog_in pins go to ADC-capable board pins.
- Bus pins prefer existing matching buses; report missing-bus.
- Strap / boot pins are deprioritized for outputs.
- Conflict + budget warnings surface for already-bound state.
- Empty / malformed inputs (no board, unknown library) fail cleanly.

    the role in the library, so we'll use a real component (bme280) but

    covers the negative case; for the positive case we rely on the
